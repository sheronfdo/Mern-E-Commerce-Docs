Below is a revised 5-day task breakdown for developing an e-commerce system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), tailored for two developers: one focused on the **backend** and the other on the **frontend**. This plan ensures parallel development, clear responsibilities, and coordination between the developers to deliver a functional platform within 5 days.

---

## Assumptions
- **Backend Developer**: Handles server-side logic, database integration, and API endpoints using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds the user interface and client-side logic using React.js, integrating with backend APIs via Axios or Fetch.
- **Collaboration**: Both developers coordinate on API contracts (endpoints, request/response formats) on Day 1 to avoid blockers.

## Day 1: Project Setup and Initial Development

### Backend Developer
**Objectives**: Set up the backend environment and implement core schemas and authentication.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Install Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
  2. Set up project structure (e.g., `models`, `routes`, `controllers`).
  3. Define MongoDB schemas for:
     - Users (buyers, sellers, couriers, admins)
     - Products
     - Categories
  4. Implement authentication endpoints:
     - `POST /api/auth/register`
     - `POST /api/auth/login`
     - Use JWT for token generation and middleware for route protection.
  5. Share API contract (endpoint details, expected JSON) with the frontend developer.

### Frontend Developer
**Objectives**: Set up the frontend environment and create initial UI components.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Install Node.js and create a React app using `create-react-app`.
  2. Set up project structure (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `services`).
  3. Install dependencies (e.g., `axios` for API calls, `react-router-dom` for routing).
  4. Create basic components:
     - Login page
     - Registration page
     - Navbar (for navigation between panels)
  5. Collaborate with the backend developer to agree on API contract for authentication.

  4. Test endpoints with Postman and share updates with the frontend developer.

### Frontend Developer
**Objectives**: Develop the buyer UI for browsing products and managing the cart.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create buyer-specific pages:
     - Product listing page (with search and filter inputs).
     - Product detail page.
  2. Build cart functionality:
     - Cart page with add/remove buttons.
     - Display cart total.
  3. Integrate authentication:
     - Connect login/registration forms to backend APIs.
     - Store JWT in localStorage and set up protected routes.
  4. Use Axios to call backend APIs for products and cart.

## Day 3: Seller and Order Management Development

### Backend Developer
**Objectives**: Develop seller APIs and initial order management features.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement seller product management endpoints:
     - `POST /api/seller/products`
     - `PUT /api/seller/products/:id`
     - `DELETE /api/seller/products/:id`
     - `GET /api/seller/products`
  2. Implement order-related endpoints:
     - `GET /api/seller/orders`
     - `PUT /api/seller/orders/:id` (status update)
     - `POST /api/orders/create` (buyer order creation)
  3. Add basic role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict endpoints by role.

### Frontend Developer
**Objectives**: Build the seller UI and start order management for buyers.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Create seller dashboard:
     - Product listing with add/edit/delete options.
     - Order list with status update controls.
  2. Build buyer order placement UI:
     - Checkout page with address selection and payment button.
  3. Integrate seller APIs:
     - Fetch and display sellerâ€™s products and orders.
     - Handle product CRUD operations via API calls.
  4. Integrate buyer order creation API (`POST /api/orders/create`).

## Day 4: Courier Panel and Enhanced Features

### Backend Developer
**Objectives**: Build courier APIs and enhance order and payment features.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Implement courier endpoints:
     - `GET /api/courier/orders`
     - `PUT /api/courier/orders/:id/status`
     - `POST /api/seller/orders/:id/assign-courier`
  2. Enhance order endpoints:
     - `GET /api/orders/history` (buyer order history)
     - `GET /api/orders/:orderId/tracking`
  3. Integrate payment gateway (e.g., Stripe):
     - `POST /api/payment/create-intent`
  4. Implement review endpoint:

### Frontend Developer
**Objectives**: Develop the courier UI and complete buyer order features.

## Coordination Notes
- **Day 1**: Both developers agree on API contracts (e.g., JSON formats, status codes) to ensure compatibility.
- **Daily Sync**: Brief daily check-ins (e.g., 15 minutes) to resolve blockers and confirm API readiness.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Frontend relies on backend APIs being available by Day 2 for integration.
  - Backend must prioritize authentication and core APIs early to unblock frontend.

This breakdown ensures that the backend and frontend developers work in parallel, completing a functional MERN stack e-commerce system for used car parts within 5 days. The system will support buyer, seller, courier, and admin functionalities, with each developer focusing on their respective domain while coordinating effectively.
